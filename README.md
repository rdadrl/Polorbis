# Polorbis
PoP (People of Polorbis) is an online text based MMORPG with DnD like mechanics. This is my side projects and I can't find time to develop it further. Uses PHP as backend.

## About the Lore

Year 890 in an alternate fiction world, Humans have evolved to different branches, each having various superior abilities, except for the Polorbis.

Polorbis'ians have been using magical powers but have very low strenght. The well of magic is being drained- how will Polorbis People will get over it? Will be there a hero to aid them?

## Backend

I have started to write my backend with PHP and DB as MySQL. I don't have to write fully pledged documentation, but I will be keeping in touch in my extra-extra-free times.
